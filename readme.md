## MangaNav Browser Extension

MangaNav is a Browser Extension that adds Previous/Next Page Navigation mapped to Left/Right Arrow Keys for Manga Sites that do not provide this Feature natively.


You can add any Site, but this Extension is specifically looking for a link with previous/next Context and maps the left/right Arrow Keys to the first link it finds rendering it non functional on Sites that dont have such Context.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Extension sources it functionality from the Website it is active on.
> Working Navigational Links need to be present for it to bind the correct href's.
> There has been only one Instance so far where the Extension failed, but the Site in question
> had broken navigation and as such could not source the correct href's.
